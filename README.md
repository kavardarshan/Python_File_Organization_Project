# Python_File_Organization_Project
This is a simple Python program that organizes files in a folder based on their file type. It checks each file’s extension (like .jpg, .pdf, etc.), creates a folder for that type if it doesn’t already exist, and moves the file into that folder. It skips folders and only works on files. You just need to change the folder path to the one you want to organize.

Let me know if you want help writing a short paragraph to submit with it!
